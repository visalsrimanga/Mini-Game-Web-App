# Mini Game Web App with JS

This mini-game web application is developed using JS (JavaScript), CSS with SCSS, and HTML. (Without using any frameworks). Here, the display repaint function (requestAnimationFrame() in JS) is used to call the browser for updating an animation before the next repaint, and also key event handlers in JS were used in the movements. The game character has the ability for moving both left and right sides and also is able to do jumps when needed. (This application only works for desktops)
